After completing the tutorial you will be able to tell Alexa what you want to see in the browser, and the website will be updated accordingly. Since this is a proof of concept, we will build a very simple website showing pictures of dogs. Once you have built a simple solution like this, you can easily extend the functionality to more complex webapps.
